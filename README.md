# Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan and I have an interest in creating software that helps me solve problems in my career as a mechanical engineer.  
Since I enjoy problem solving, I also find programming to be a fun and rewarding hobby!!! 

I am currently most familiar with Python but am always looking to expand my knowledge.
