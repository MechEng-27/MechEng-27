# Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan and I have an interest in creating software that helps me solve problems in my career as a mechanical engineer.  
Since I enjoy problem solving, I also find programming to be a fun and rewarding hobby!!! 

I've built some applications with Python but lately I've been having fun playing around with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React etc.
